# CherryPicked

## Description

We built this website for a simpler way to find meal and drink recipes. Once on the website, the user types a meal and drink ingredient then clicks the search icon. Then recipes will show up for the user with a list to choose from. We used NinjaAPI for our meal and drink recipes, and materialize CSS and JavaScript.
